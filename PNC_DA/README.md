Project Summary
This project involves creating a comprehensive dataset for the PNC insurance industry and performing various analyses to understand customer behavior, policy trends, and potential strategies for brokers and customer retention.

Key Features
Dataset Creation: A Python script is used to generate a sample dataset with relevant attributes such as policy details, customer information, vehicle types, and engagement metrics.

Data Analysis: SQL queries are developed to analyze the dataset, including descriptive statistics, uni-variate and bi-variate analyses, and relational database queries.

ER Diagram: An Entity-Relationship diagram is designed to visualize the structure of the database, highlighting entities and their relationships.

Strategic Insights: The analysis provides insights into choosing the best line of business, policy renewal rates based on coverage and policy types, and strategies for retaining customers.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Used for generating the dataset and performing preliminary data manipulation.

SQL: Utilized for querying and analyzing the dataset.

Entity-Relationship Diagramming: Employed to visualize the database structure.

Future Enhancements
Data Visualization: Incorporating data visualization tools to better represent findings and trends.

Machine Learning Integration: Potential integration of machine learning models to predict policy renewal rates or customer churn.
